## Introduction

Hello and welcome to this workshop on less-known useful features of Git. Git is one tool that we as developers use each and every day, therefore it makes sense to become more efficient at using it. What I discovered, however that as with most advanced technologies, as soon as one learns the basics, the motivation to learn fades. The goal of this workshop is to explore less known features that can make working with Git more productive and fun.

If you have ever talked version control to non-developers, you know how difficult it is to convince them to use version control instead of saving file copies with increasingly cryptic names.

Even the basics of Git feel unnecessarily complicated, as if it were made by the creator of Linux or something. However after you learn the main commands, you are good to go.

However if you want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes you can read the official Git bible, available for free at https://git-scm.com/book/

![Pro Git](images/pro-git.png)

This book covers almost all the useful features for both users and Git admins.

However, if you want to be a happier person, you can instead look at project Legit, it wraps the common branch workflow into just 7 commands

So let's get started!

### Configuration

The fastest and most rewarding trick is to configure your Git.

All of the configuration is done with `git config` command and one of 3 flags:

* `--system` for all users (`/etc/gitconfig`)
* `--global` just for you (`/home/%username%/.gitconfig`)
* `--local` just for project (`.../project/.git/config`)

In real life, however, only the `--global` and `--local` configurationes are useful.

#### Aliases

One of the most time-saving configurations is aliases. If you find yourself typing or tab-completing the same command every day and it's longer than 3 keystrokes, aliases are there for you.

Here are 3 examples of such aliases:

```bash
sudo git config --system alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
git config --local alias.pod "pull origin dev"
```

* The first one allows any user on the host to type `git co` instead of `git checkout`

* The second command provides a colourful replacement for a rather verbose default output of `git log`

_demonstrate_

* The third command is specific to the sportamore project where all the branches pull changes from `origin dev`

As expected, each alias is written to one of the three configuration files:

```bash
less /etc/gitconfig
less ~/.gitconfig
less ~/sportamore/sportamore/.git/config
```

### Git Autocorrect
So, let's continue.

### Find bugs with git-bisect

While you were on vacation someone created a bug. Instead of "Hello World!" the main page shows "Â¡Hola, mundo!".

Like with many things in Git, you only need a few subcommands to work. Here they are `start`, `bad`, and `good`.

```bash
git-bisect start
cat bisect/index.html  # has mundo
git bisect bad
git checkout 41ff7
cat bisect/index.html  # has World
git bisect good
```

Let's automate the search. Enter `git bisect run my_script arguments`
The script should return:

* 0 for good
* 1 for bad
* 125 for cannot test

```
git bisect bad
git bisect good 41ff7
git bisect run ./bisect_test_.sh
```

Notes from documentation:
* As an alternative, you can use `new` instead of `bad` and `old` instead of good
* In real world not every commit can be tested, e.g. build fails. You have Options
  - `git reset --hard HEAD~3`  # try 3 commits ago
  - `git bisect skip`  # current commit
  - `git bisect skip v2.5..v2.6`  # skip a range of commits
* Narrow down to directories
* Give more than one good commit
* Automatically bisect a broken test

### Git archaeology
Often when reading code one can wonder who wrote this and what were they smoking. Luckily for us, Git records all the history and we can do some Git archaeology to figure out why is the code the way it is. The first tool you would use is `git blame`. It shows the commit, author, and date for every line of code. However, sometimes it's not enough. We may inspect a commit with `git show {commit hash}` to see that the poor person we were cursing for the last 10 minutes just refactored the code.

### Git Hooks
In almost any collaborative coding project there are rules. These rules can be about code style, commit message format, who can edit which files and so on. Many of these rules are so simple that a robot can do it. And it should. That's where Git hooks step in. There are 2 types of hooks:

* Server Side
* Client Side


Can be bypassed with `--no-verify`
